# African Marketplace 2019

## Pitch
Sauti Africa empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunitites to grow out of poverty. 

You will build a platform to enable these business owners to create listing for items they have for sale.

## MVP
A small business owner can log on and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices. 

They can also make listing for what they want to sell, which will show up to all users. 

They can add a new item by selecting their market location, and then typing in their item name, description, and price.
